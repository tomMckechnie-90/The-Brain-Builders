# Heading Flip and Match Cards Game
## Project Description:
### This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a memory game called Flip and Match Cards Game. The cards are flipped in twos and if they match, they are kept open while the player continues the game. If the cards do not match, they are flipped back to the board while the player continues the game. When the opened cards match, the player wins and receives a score.
